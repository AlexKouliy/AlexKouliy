👋 Hey, I’m Alex Kouliy
Founder of Nulltech Designs · Originator of Care-Centered Design (CCD)
🎨 Graphic Designer · 💻 Developer · 🧩 Systems Architect

I build emotionally intelligent systems that bridge design, psychology, accessibility, and technology.
My work focuses on how digital environments shape the human nervous system, and how we can create interfaces, products, and communication that support clarity, calm, and user sovereignty.

🔧 Current Work
Care-Centered Design (CCD)
A next-generation design standard that unifies:
Accessibility (WCAG, COGA)
Human-Centered Design
Trauma-Informed Practice
Affective and Somatic Science
CCD reframes accessibility from compliance to care, and treats interfaces as nervous-system architecture.
This work emerged from a 5-month research residency, 75+ technical notes, and case studies including Hexxed and Healing.

🧭 Frameworks & Methods
I create systems that make complexity usable:
URSA × ORCM — Orientation + Refinement Loop
A process model for designers, developers, and writers that keeps empathy, structure, and polish connected in one iterative cycle.
EQFT — Emotional-Field Quantification Toolkit
Maps color, motion, hierarchy, and tone to affective “field” variables that help regulate user experience.
Stormtech — Ethics of Emotional-Technologies
A principled approach for systems that interact with user emotion or physiology.

🎨 Design Practice
My work blends:
Advanced colour theory & perception
Gestalt and cognitive load research
Accessibility engineering
Trauma-informed interaction design
Systems thinking & symbolic architecture
I believe design should reduce harm, clarify complexity, and support diverse nervous systems.

🧪 Recent Projects
1000 Miles Apart Centennial Conference – Visual identity for AUArts’ 2025 ceramics conference
Access Ability – A cognitive accessibility project using CCD principles
Unified Science of Colour – A cross-disciplinary study on colour perception
Path of the Ancients – Motion design + narrative system development

🧱 What You’ll Find Here
This GitHub documents the development of CCD and the systems around it:
Draft standards and definitions
Case studies and applied UX redesigns
URSA × ORCM process templates
EQFT variable mapping
Care-Centered audit checklists
Notes on colour, cognition, and somatic design
This is a living research archive as the framework moves toward a formal v1 standard.

🌱 Current Goal
To refine, structure, and publish Care-Centered Design v1 as a publicly accessible design standard — supported by documentation, case studies, and a design-system starter kit.
